I sense tone disrespect viewers\\' intelligence. Additionally, deeply disturbing see critics give movie high rating see news outlets publish articles questioning seriously take backlash. It flaw ratings system. Sure, casual young viewers enjoy. But backlash real, crusty old fanboys nostalgic good ol\\' days complaining political agendas (not fanboys always illegitimate arguments).

       " 'I hate TLJ, even I completely ignore (among many fans) controversial choices Rian Johnson made regards treatement Star Wars\\' lore characters, I still great number qualms film terms storytelling (sorry, going rather long):PACING: Now probably biggest issue film. Apart opening battle, film little forward momentum nearly two thirds running time. After action-heavy beginning, plot gets tangled 3 separate storylines unfold simultaneously. My (perhaps personal) problem I found 2 neither emotionally involving thrilling: Finn/Rose subplot finding code-breaker \"Casino Planet\" Canto Bight well Poe/Holdo storyline resistance\\' messy escape First Order universe\\'s sluggish space chase. But one story I ready fully invested - know: one Rey Luke island (and Kylo via Force-Skype) - offers little terms action visual excitement, also never really gets time breathe: overall narrative requires film cut back forth two evolving story threads.\\n \\nThe result narrative structure 90 minutes scenes Rey Luke (and little Kylo) dreary, grey island beg resonate emotionally blunted time film\\'s cut (for me) somewhat uninvolving action Finn\\'s Poe\\'s part universe. And two storylines lose sense urgency keep getting interrupted scenes island Rey Luke - which, make matters worse, develop several days film Finn\\'s Poe\\'s stories unfold couple hours.Due uneven structure end two-and-a-half-hour movie crucial scenes story never enough room breathe even feel rushed. It\\'s three storylines start coming together last third film film\\'s pacing really works me. But getting often feels like chore (and I\\'m really sure Star Wars film feel like work).ODD CHARACTER CHOICES: What purpose Leia coma better part film? Don\\'t tell set Kylo thinks dead: connected Force, he\\'s plugged Force one be; established Star Wars lore tells us anything, Kylo would instantly feel mother died (now that\\'s something even casual fan knows). So use Leia more? Why introduce completely new character Laura Dern\\'s Admiral Holdo, essentially functions stand-in Leia?Poe Dameron\\'s whole arc film learning terrible human cost stupid, vain heroism, Leia clashes, he\\'s sacrificed half resistance\\' fleet order take single Dreadnought film\\'s opening battle. And soon Leia\\'s coma, almost exact conflict continues Holdo. Nothing Admiral Holdo, hard invested character, met her; storytelling point view, make Poe\\'s arc really resonate raise stakes (and audience), would make sense rebelled Leia. Wasting coma instead seems utterly pointless.BIG MOMENTS: Unlike immediate predecessor, TLJ shuns familiar formula. It\\'s forward momentum, action - unfortunately, fails provide audience emotionally involving story instead. It may take characters unexpected directions, new directions turn somewhat... rather \"mature\" choices terms storytelling instead exciting ones? Yes, several grand moments film work great intellectual level, fail reach us gut level. Whenever film tries build big emotional moment, moment ends feeling, well, big - naturally could deliberate choice director subvert formula, end? Surely, subversion can\\'t main goal?For example, take scene Rey learns Kylo parents nobodies they\\'re long dead. The problem scene reveal itself: scene\\'s execution. It\\'s huge reveal Rey, weight. It could - probably - emotional moment film; heart-felt gut-punch heroine, instead just: *fighting* - \"Your parents nobodies, they\\'re dead.\" - \"Yes, I feel too.\" - *fighting continues*. I important moment treated fleetingly.In contrast, look Lawrence Kasdan J.J. Abrams staged The Force Awaken\\'s emotional scene: Han Solo\\'s death hands own, terribly conflicted son. Now say film want, scene huge emotional impact viewer. It weight. Imagine scene happened fight, heated moment, narrative proceed without giving room? These storytelling choices Rian Johnson movie favors. I would ready applaud director\\'s (and/or Disney\\'s) decision try something different TFA, I lament failure develop emotional gravitas - film\\'s unwillingness ever raise stakes lead characters. Until end, I never feel like protagonists real danger. Nor ever confronted shocking consequences reckless actions personal level; Finn Poe\\'s great ideas plans directly lead senseless deaths dozens, hundreds people - casualties numbers; they\\'re exploding spaceships witness afar; heroes (and audience) never forced feel full weight loss.As consequence, there\\'s nothing make war\\'s terrible cost really resonate us. This film needs heartfelt punch gut; I\\'m challenging protagonists morally give intellectually satisfying arcs, resulting storylines still exciting enough make heart pound. And I know I speak myself, heartbeat hardly ever accelerated throughout entire two-and-a-half-hour running time - all.TLJ\\'S ISSUES AS A DIRECT SEQUEL: TFA teased boatload things come, I\\'m theoretically board many unexpected directions Rian Johnson took characters TLJ, I confused decision ignore many plot threads set Lawrence Kasdan J.J. Abrams TFA. Because due unorthodox approach, watching two films back back jarringly weird experience. Regardless one feels TFA, even bothering acknowledge came strange - almost offending many people fully invested mysteries could hardly wait promised reveals.And tell J.J. Abrams blame; - every right expectations: TLJ IS direct sequel TFA. In sense BACK TO THE FUTURE II direct sequel BACK TO THE FUTURE: kind sequel continues seconds first film ends, resulting one unbroken storyline developing two films. And course director go unexpected directions sequel - hell: audience want to. In fact, IS part expectation one reasons go movies (and BTTF II brilliantly) - pretending like important plot points huge moments previous film simply matter even happen comes dangerously close playing audience fools.Not artist (or huge conglomerate) creative licence - go road act surprised inevitable backlash. And I honestly going new directions result uneven transition first film second; way I see even couple lines dialog characters like Luke, Snoke Kylo-Ren would enough tie prominent lose ends least leave dangling air like this. I mean, I Johnson want us interested Snoke\\'s story (and whole bunch things made feel important TFA) HE interested it. But writer could point across still address issue (because previous film told audience BE interested it) - quickly resolve offhanded manner take story wants go.SUMMARY: The Last Jedi structurally uneven often frustrating film almost always refuses give heroes - audience - satisfaction. It film large stretches running time concerned subverting formula teaching lessons importance failure, fails realize watching heroes fail two half hours may unexpected, frankly - also bit tiring.It may gutsy unexpected move Johnson throw mysteries teased TFA, question audiences - time - answer whether offers instead worthy replacement.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/',\n",

The film problems, hurts movie. I still enjoyed movie I fun. Return Jedi (1983) directed time Richard Marquand different director directed Irvin Kershner George Lucas. This movie released year I born 1983. The film pretty good way, thing suffers problems flaws.Things I like movie: The first hour set back planet Tatooine rescue mission I like, story set first movie begins ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, R2-D2 return Tatooine rescue Han Solo (who encased carbonite end Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) gangster Jabba Hutt (voice: Larry Ward).A battle ship, Luke steadily taking fight Jabba\\'s men.

Deeply affected sight son dying him, Vader repents turns Emperor, throwing reactor shaft death.Luke try\\'s save Anakin dies could save him.I feel Luke\\'s transition teenager calm collected warrior Force feels authentic. His conflict Darth Vader Emperor contains best scenes entire saga.Things I like: The film problems really unnecessary I really hate it: This movie\\'s biggest flaw pacing, Ewoks role film. Star Wars forest, Star Wars suppose set Galaxy forest? Personally I mind Ewoks, introduction causes movie comes screeching halt. Another fault movie attempts humor. It feels often unnatural forced time. The Phantom Menace notorious problem well, likely originated here.Master Yoda dies film! Why? Watching Yoda prequels I really enjoyed I watching last two movies.

With massive story lines, wonder Lucas manages squeeze best every plot line, without straying film\\'s important element, Anakin\\'s seduction Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine. After vision wife, Padme, dying childbirth, Jedi prodigy Anakin Skywalker consults chancellor, expertly influences young Jedi turning dark side force. The entire seduction works brilliantly. With seeds Anakin\\'s tragic flaw planted way back The Phantom Menace, expanded upon Attack Clones, Revenge Sith free focus straw broke camel\\'s back. Anakin\\'s desperation save Padme\\'s life makes eventual turn believable, Ian McDiarmid Hayden Christensen well portraying icy relationship turns destructive mentorship. Anakin\\'s final fall, framed alongside rise Empire storytelling masterclass. Palpatine\\'s seduction subtle, yet dramatic, numerous loose ends originals tied certain kind poetry. For writing deficiencies, Lucas spins fable elegantly, delicacy makes realize, he\\'s dreaming telling story long, long time.

You really believe young Obi-Wan that's well done also heartbreaking moments Anakin end. One biggest flaws prequels political conversations. Just lots lots lots talking makes want fall asleep, thankfully, Lucas listened fans reduced here. It's still present, course, much. Romance Padme Anakin little bit believable here, still enough that's one biggest flaws here, blame Attack Clones case. Everything executed well leading original trilogy good, even tho create plot holes, Star Wars explain almost everything Force. And one good thing Jar Jar haters, appears like, second. Hooray!

It terrible last two improved. There lines bad dialogue like Darth Vaders Noooooo end.3. You can\\'t blame actors bad scripts given good. For example people hate Hayden Christensen, however defense, could act kind dialogue anyway? thought good job it.4. This prequel boring. The two politic talk peace treaty signings, film battles lightsaber fights. I really like opening battle Coruscant, CGI already looks better really shows war republic separatists. Next lightsaber battle Obi wan Anakin vs Count Dooku. I already think lightsaber battle better one ll. It better choreographed really feel tension Chancellor Palatine\\'s voice says \"do it\" Anakin kill Dooku, gives little hint emperor. After Obi Wan vs General Grievous, I think good battle bit short I also like battle Kashyyyk Utapau. After really Mace Windu vs Palpatine. I like battle I think 3 Jedi start killed way easily battle lacking pace. However I really like scene Anakin choose save Windu Palpatine. Then order 66. Love idea. George Lucas explains scene Jedi wiped galaxy Palpatine ordered clone army, see Yoda\\'s face feeling afterwards. The last action scenes movie two lightsaber battles end. Anakin vs Obi Wan Yoda vs Emperor. I think Yoda vs Emperor good fight wanted see know Yoda never lightsaber original trilogy lost battling emperor, good battle nothing compared one. Anakin vs Obi wan favourite lightsaber fight prequels, entire saga. It everything fast pace, action, emotion , flips , background music stunning. Battle Heroes one favourite Star Wars pieces.5. The Plot. This film compelling story, I love way Chancellor Palpatine persuades Anakin think ready Jedi master council approve, frustrates Anakin Palpatine knew would. Then thing thinks Anakin fight General Grievous. Every time Anakin talks Palpatine, starts talk Dark side, like told Darth Plagieus wise. I love quote \"is possible learn power? Not Jedi\". Palpatine knows Anakin fear mother lied power. I think great idea, really showed us temptation manipulation dark side. So After Anakin kills Mace Windu says \"I pledge teachings\", part I like transition dark side rushed. 9 minutes said line killing younglings! Don\\'t wrong I like order 66 Jedi temple March song, really shows republic\\'s fall empires rise. The next biggest scene emotion Obi wan lightsaber battle Mustafar. The acting Ewan McGregor better ever really shows brother Anakin. The next scenes connection scenes liking 3 4, transition works makes perfect sense though.6.

One Anakin\\'s character flaws understand difference controlling feelings suppressing them. To me, Hayden\\'s monotone showed Anakin suppressing emotions partially responsible fall. I see warning dangerous suppress feelings without giving kind outlet. Furthermore, Hayden\\'s actually rather good acting expressions body language. For example, alone Mustafar killing Separatists single line, tear track running face showed part Vader hated he\\'d become.Samuel L Jackson nailed role Mace Windu, particularly duel Palpatine. The fight brilliant, particularly Sidious killed three Jedi, Samuel used subtle gestures make work. For example, biggest flaw fight, apart ignominious deaths Agen Kolar, Saesee Tinn Kit Fisto, Sidious held Mace blade-point. One might wonder strike Windu me, way Windu spread arms basically said \"come go\", subtly undermining Sidious\\' confidence causing hesitate. The confidence Mace held explains Sidious take advantage opening straight away. There\\'s also tiny gesture Mace gave Anakin held Sidious blade-point, subtly motioning stand back. Mace also represents Jedi Order\\'s flaws, making unlikable character despite Samuel\\'s excellent portrayal him.

I mean disrespect late Alec Guinness great Original Trilogy, I think Ewan surpassed him. He certainly better lightsaber duelling also nailed Obi-Wan\\'s calm, confident presence. For example, jumped middle group battle droids confront General Grievous, say \"Hello there\" meant business.

Of course, \"Attack Clones\" also troubles own. Although quite grandiose visual effects spectacle – predecessors – smaller, character- driven parts story George Lucas absolutely botches, almost comical effect.Central entire prequel trilogy story Darth Vader becomes Darth Vader Galactic Empire rises power, means Lucas trajectory must follow. It\\'s clear many ways story screenplay slave this. Everything must add fit original \"Star Wars\" trilogy Lucas must connect dots, even want connect.The dots critical story ones trace Anakin Skywalker\\'s (Hayden Christensen) path dark side becoming father Luke Leia. Therefore, must turn evil – fall love – time.Because \"The Phantom Menace\" little legwork Anakin\\'s turn dark side, everything falls \"Attack Clones\" put motion. Right away, presented cocky, reckless young padowan Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) nothing like little \"Ani\" \"Episode I.\" He also extremely forward Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), because, well, fall love time believable way.Before ripping unfortunate romantic subplot, worth noting else \"Clones\" entertaining. Running film pretty solid mystery thread: As dangerous separatist movement gains steam Republic, now-Senator Amidala finds life threatened Obi-Wan Anakin assigned protect her, possible, identify would-be assassin.

       " 'Much like predecessor, Star Wars - Episode II: Attack Clones gained rather sour reputation internet. Fortunately, many popular complaints film either highly exaggerated downright wrong. Chapter two Star Wars Saga energized highly enjoyable two hours movies.Attack Clones follows Anakin Skywalker ten years exploits The Phantom Menace. An older Anakin, played surprisingly well Hayden Christiansen, training watchful eye Ewan McGregor\\'s Obi-Wan Kenobi. Searching Internet, find many fans praise Christiansen\\'s performance, I found effective young, arrogant hotshot role he\\'d given. McGregor similarly well older brother, mentor role. I enjoyed Episode I lot, story focused time, major events happening Anakin, actual political conflict engulfing Republic. The two major story lines film are, one, political underpinnings eventually lead start infamous Clone Wars, two, personal story Anakin Skywalker, including romance former Queen, Padme Amidala. The first story lines wildly interesting, following two opposing forces Clone Wars, The Republic clone army, Seperatists droid battalion, prepare imminent war. After assassination attempt Senetor Amidala, Obi-Wan embarks detective mission track people behind plot. The political espionage behind-the-scenes dealings make fascinating focused story. The major storyline focused, still works chapter Anakin Skywalker\\'s overall story. Anakin Padme\\'s love story works throwback grand, old-fashioned film romances 1930s 40s (think Gone With Wind), contemporary audiences, extended scenes corny \"love speech\" dialogue might pretty drab. However, distracting offensive claim. In fact, couple actually work well, meadow picnic, Padme Anakin discuss futility politics beautiful fields Naboo. The actors chemistry, likable, especially Natalie Portman Padme. Yes love story bit forced, sometimes drab, fits feel saga. It grand, sweeping, throwback Hollywood\\'s golden age.If love story might hit miss, facet Anakin\\'s character arc Lucas gets absolutely right. Plagued visions mother pain, Anakin takes Padme Tatooine tracks mother, see die arms. His response chilling powerful. The scene Padme garage brings mom\\'s body back perfectly executed, unveiling dark, angry side Anakin, simultaneously showing frailty confusion. It truly one best scenes saga.Even find story interesting I did, question Episode II audio/visual feast senses. Lucas company introduce stunning variety sprawling landscapes, crazy creatures, fanciful vehicles, formidable weapons. Once again, sheer amount imagination contained world unbelievable. While Attack Clones tend favor CGI backgrounds creatures much, still looks undeniably cool. The nighttime skyline Coruscant, rain-drenched clone facility Kamino, termite mound planet Geonosis; They all, along creatures inhabit them, feel real, look great. On beautiful planets, treated tons terrific Star Wars action. George Lucas revels directing off-the-wall fun. This film adventure through. Set-pieces range one-on-one battle bounty hunter Jango Fett Obi- Wan rainy platforms Kamino gladiator-like fight intergalactic monsters. The last half hour film particularly impresses, massive battle two giant armies, dozens Jedis, helping fantastic war machines. The whole thing ends epic face-off sees Yoda battle mind sword Christopher Lee\\'s devilishly evil Count Dooku, memorable villain air gravitas. He\\'s classic Hollywood archetype Star Wars spin; elegant villain happens lightsaber (with awesome curved handle) shoot lightning hands.Needless say, Attack Clones better reputation suggests.

Lucas always pushed limits technology, even inventing new technology way.  He sold changed relied special effects, always concentrated effects.  If digital technology 20 years ago, would done thing now.  That's does; makes worlds exist comes way put film.-The writing bad new films: Does anybody recall Lucas ever receiving Pulitzer Prize?-The acting bad new films: Carrie Fisher???  Mark Hamill??? Harrison Ford???  We're exactly talking Academy Award winners here.  Name one original main actors actually great actor (other Sir Alec).  Now, Harrison Ford great career, he's Jack Nicholson.  And Carrie Fisher Mark Hamill now?-Anakin whiny little brat: Does anybody also remember whiny Luke first two movies?  I mean, nothing whine complain Jedi.  And many times say Luke like father?

While I agree original trilogy tough act follow, I grossly let movie were.The thing happened second STAR WARS prequels, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, released 2002. Many predicted movie would satisfy disliked Episode I vengeance, alas, case. Once again, critics damned movie one reason another, heated debate whether Lucas \"trashed original trilogy\" still going on. I find sad Lucas would still receive unfair critical attack, even making darker, somber, ominous movie ATTACK OF THE CLONES. I\\'m guessing naysayers continue say nay Lucas matter like rabid fans Anime would continue slam-dunk dubs... even recently proved excellent.This say ATTACK OF THE CLONES flawless film. It actually share problems THE PHANTOM MENACE have. The dialogue, although nowhere nearly bad critics disgruntled fans say, lacks spark original trilogy. My biggest gripe movie moves leisurely pace, lots weak, unsatisfying sequences last long. Most scenes consist love subplot involving Anakin Skywalker Amidala Padme. When interacting other, Hayden Christensen Natalie Portman fine respective roles. (Christensen\\'s monologue slaughtering Tusken Raiders but--horrors!--women children frightening.) But sense awkwardness contribute scenes involve schmaltzy lines screen kisses.

Actually, also make Episode II worth watching fantastic set designs. Every location movie, metropolis skyscrapers Coruscant water planet prototypes Stormtroopers constructed literally bursts imagination eye candy.Of performers I liked Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) best; acting still little shaky times, seems comfortable role. Christopher Lee makes surprise appearance new villain, Count Dooku, delivers first-rate evil character. And great see C-3PO R2-D2 usual banter (although sometimes gags occur necessary). Ultimately, however, film belongs Jedi Master Yoda, played perfection Frank Oz.

His mouth perfectly sync every word says, final showdown Dooku absolute highlight.While ATTACK OF THE CLONES is, ways, lesser entry STAR WARS franchise, assets outweigh weaknesses; questions I first seem addressed little bit chapter, and, frustratingly enough, provides questions Episode III.

The Models looked real, told I first saw I 6 CGI, I would believed you! Everyone best. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Darth Vader, etc. They great!Now new nearly good old series, I believe prequel trilogy SERIOUSLY underrated. They good old movies, still amazing movies! It shows new side things. It brings something new plate. It shows Anakin able turn innocent boy menacing Darth Vader. It showed Palpatine set trap destroyed Republic created Empire. It dug deeper meant Jedi, easily led astray let guard down. It gives us 2 paths. The Path Luke, Path Anakin.Now I done explaining, time I wrote review for. To review Attack Clones. I agree many flaws. I agree CGI movie. However, I think advertise special effects. If want movie that, go see \"2012\" \"At World\\'s End.\" This one weaker movies, still amazing.If look closely, see parallelism trilogies. \"Phantom Menace\" \"A New Hope\" introduced us characters. A major character major loss (Obi- Wan/Luke). The main character destroys ship causing trouble (Anakin/Luke). The main character comes humble origins (Anakin/Luke). The thing happened \"Revenge Sith\" \"Return Jedi\" (my 2 favorites series). Except opposites. Anakin Luke choose different paths. But fight someone close (Obi-Wan mentor/Darth Vader father). Palpatine set plan order. But results different (Destruction Republic/Destruction Empire). In one see great sadness (Padme\\'s funeral Creation Darth Vader) see great joy (Celebrations throughout galaxy). We also see parallelism \"Attack Clones\" \"Empire Strikes Back.\" We see characters evolve first movie third.In \"Attack Clones,\" see many things. We see Anakin struggles loss mother (Luke struggled friends danger). We see Palpatine sets plan slowly destroy Republic. We see started Clone Wars, Palpatine used advantage.

We hear Anakin whine three seconds. Usually, someone butchers whole village men, women, children there's whole soul searching going afterward. Of course, Lucas goes pansy route glosses whole thing. Most people I've talked even remember scene brought them.I'm probably one people completely disgusted witht Yoda fight end unimpressive Darth Sarumon (Lee plays exact character LOTR: former wizard turned evil lackey=former jedi turned evil lackey). It's almost instead hand Yoda's posterior they've inserted heroin suppository. Lucas has, brief half-minute, meaningless fight scene, destroyed mystery Yoda. The entire fight unwarranted.

       " 'Lucas may problems director writer, I\\'ve always thought flaws balanced great storytelling ability. The problem \"The Phantom Menace\" simply story tell. The film merely adds introductory chapter story already told, stretches two-hour movie. It accident prequels kind rare. They difficult make properly. And apparently he\\'s sophisticated enough filmmaker pull off.For one thing, project limited fact anyone familiar first trilogy knows story\\'s outcome, therefore lacks suspense associated gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, situation leaves Lucas little freedom storyteller. It also encourages gloss key events; outcome foregone conclusion, forgets bring life.For example, know eventually romance Anakin Padme. So Lucas two characters meet and--surprise, surprise--they seem like other. Their developing friendship portrayed clearly, motivations becoming close explained. Because Lucas fails make scenes like believable, can\\'t help conscious he\\'s manipulating plot effort connect two trilogies. Another good example problem Anakin\\'s portrayal potential Jedi. There appear anything kid remotely ordinary, even though characters keep talking like is. Our reason thinking he\\'s special plot requires it.If story fails engaging, never see important events. Lucas makes fatal error showing what\\'s happening Naboo, small planet whose capture focus plot. Numerous atrocities supposedly committed planet\\'s inhabitants, know characters screen refer events, usually rather woodenly.The deadpan performances problem themselves, highlight lack involvement story. Think Han Solo sweating fear, think emotional vacuums passing characters film. Whenever characters express emotion, scene Anakin mom part, still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages keep emotional reactions characters minimum, gives film almost mechanical feel.It\\'s true \"A New Hope\" never showed Alderaan\\'s inhabitants, still could feel tragedy planet\\'s destruction horrified reactions Princess Leia Obi Wan. Moreover, many involving events witnessed directly, slaying rebels beginning; capture torture princess; murder Luke\\'s foster parents. Furthermore, major plot elements intriguing themselves. They merely us linked later events, seems case new film.I suspect Lucas concerned first trilogy happen later story therefore able focus attention events hand. The weakest segment \"Return Jedi,\" task bringing story end. Only Lucas start signs forcing plot points. In \"The Phantom Menace,\" gets bogged task bringing story point A point B ends bare bones plot, none comes alive.This especially true characterization. In old trilogy, characters like Yoda Han reveal distinct personalities first minutes screen. This film goes two hours characters, including familiar ones, come vague nondescript. We given chance experience personalities way interact. We must take Qui Gon\\'s word describes Obi Wan \"headstrong.\" What\\'s odd cartoons seem better developed humans. The scenes Qui Gon negotiates birdlike slave-owner Watto amusing well-done--probably movie\\'s best scenes aside stunning action sequences--but can\\'t hold candle constant interactions throughout first trilogy.One thing I cannot accuse film lacking creativity. The design creatures, technologies, planets impressive. Watching film sort like reading children\\'s book good abounds beautiful illustrations. There certainly \"wow\" factor movie\\'s visuals, effect short-lived.I irked I hear fans talk though \"Star Wars\" movies never anything beyond special effects. While inventive visuals part made originals revolutionary, they\\'re made films fun watch. And way explain trilogy\\'s continuing popularity today.

His manner odd, perhaps abrasive, offers far single note Lucas used original comic-relief characters. And, course, fact one first fully digital characters film history worth something. But Ian McDiarmid\\'s Senator Palpatine perhaps under-appreciated all. This Oscar-worthy supporting performance, character frighteningly real perfectly ambiguous. McDiarmid balances performance knife\\'s edge, managing fatherly deeply unsettling.Yes, may certain human dimension weaker original Star Wars. We clear \"hero\". There\\'s Luke, Han. That\\'s valid point, inevitably criticism. Qui Gon Obi Wan comic-book heroes A New Hope, likable, heroic, rich characterization. If I choice seeing 10 episodes life Han Solo Qui Gon Jinn, I\\'d choose latter without hesitation.Story: The storyline film seems real, substantial five. We perfect sense scale, human drama global (or interstellar) conflict. The one quibble might pod race. It\\'s certainly entertaining, go long? I think perhaps so. This structural weakness, huge one. (Does Luke spend WAY long Dagobah, listening warmed Zen platitudes rubbery little jerk Yoda? Yes! Yet film viewers seem to, unaccountably, pick \"best\" six. Clearly, there\\'s latitude narrative digressions...)And there\\'s climactic sword fight. I\\'d rate three-way duel Phantom Menace second-best sword fight Star Wars series, close finale Return Jedi. The latter wonderful mythic quality, one visceral, scary... partly Darth Maul cold, merciless villain, partly know outset outcome genuinely doubt, one Good Guys really could die. And staging, using three master swordsmen, different technique... This good action film gets. Only two three movie duels come close: Rob Roy, Neeson, oddly enough; Scaramouche; Robin Hood... I can\\'t think fourth. The closing duel ALONE raise Phantom Menace front ranks action fantasy films.Bottom line: enjoy film, see, feel, amazing anyone possibly rate 7 8. This scale film making ever attempted, let alone pulled beautifully. Perhaps that\\'s film\\'s biggest fault: Lucas makes seem easy.But, course, know REAL reason people can\\'t give film 10 richly deserves. That reason lies within themselves. Viewers 1999 (let alone 2007) feel young, innocent, optimistic saw first Star Wars. (Especially saw way back 1977, 30 years ago). Star Wars changed, George Lucas changed, nearly audience changed. Alas. Moviegoers truly jaded can\\'t feel passion revel breadth vision The Phantom Menace sincerest sympathy. Yes, ever so-o cool putting prequel trilogy, missing one best movies time high price pay.',\n",
       " \"The main line defence seems be: lighten up, entertainment / kid's movie / special effects flick.  Pausing awhile note people run line defence conceded film is, fact, bad, let's take points one one - shall we?As entertainment poor.  Dialogue flat perfunctory (don't expect dazzled repartee); story lacks beauty first Star Wars film tension second ... there's magical `character development' everyone complains about.  We must distinguish character development character delineation.  The former nice, latter absolutely essential, latter that's missing `The Phantom Menace'.  Jar Jar, young Obi Wan, Darth Maul, Armidala, Annakin - scarcely characters all, difficult enthused about.  Jar Jar particular collection mannerisms, nothing more.  This lack character prevent film becoming darling intellectuals - makes dull.  There hundreds entertaining films.  Only people entered cinema carrying plastic light sabers, grimly determined enjoy themselves, failed notice this.It's kid's movie.  Well, yes, sense - good sense.  Good children's movies form proper subset good movies - simply adults access childhood emotions desires, vice versa.  So one sense `kid's movie' movie understood apperaciated children (as well adults).  Is kid's movie sense?  Maybe.  But also kid's movie bad sense: deeply witless, inexperienced children might - I say, MIGHT - fail notice witless is.  Children may - I say, MAY - ignore fact Jar Jar Binks deeply irritating non-character colour movement speaks funny.  Is really want?Special effects.  These hot, either.  George Lucas fallen love computers failed notice digital animals move way real animals move - worse still, move like kind physical object all.  Nor alleged physical objects.  Compare trundling white juggernaut start `Star Wars' - convincingly solid model - insubstantial collection pixels darts past us start `The Phantom Menace'.  The special effects actually deteriorated, make matters worse, them.So defence `The Phantom Menace' allowed poor movie really trying something great first place, wash.  Especially so, given ludicrous claims George Lucas arrogantly made, again.  So Jar Jar Binks first digitally created main character?  Rubbish - dragon `Dragonheart' predates (and, one might add, least genuine character).  So George Lucas pioneering new kind filming-making, like painting less like photography, old?  Absolute twaddle - Walt Disney THAT 1930s.  I'll tell IS new.  Never sizzle, little sausage.\"]"

    "It is hard to find what all these clusters are centered on semantically, but there are some clear patterns. Star Wars as a franchise is divided into three trilogies: the original, the prequels, and the sequels or newest Star Wars movies, post Disney acquisition. It is clear to me that there are clusters that primarily discuss each of these trilogies based on character names like Anakin, Luke, and Rey. Additionally, it appears some clustering is happening based on positive and negative reviews."
